# Arduino
random experiments for Arduino UNO

Everything is written in plain or native C without Arduino libraries


Makefiles, scripts etc. are written on a Linux machine and should work for unixoid systems.
Windows will be supported if you provide patches and / or Microsofts integration of bash are available.
