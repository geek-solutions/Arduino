# Arduino
Programming for Arduino UNO / ATmega 328P in native / plain C
No Arduino libraries are used.

Makefiles, scripts etc. are written on a Linux machine and should work for unixoid systems.
Windows will be supported if you provide patches and / or Microsofts integration of bash is available.

You are going to need:
  make
  gcc-avr
  avr-libc
  avrdude
